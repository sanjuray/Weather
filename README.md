I delved into creating a Weather App using the OpenWeatherMap API and Retrofit in Android Studio. 📱☀️

Key Highlights:
✅ Leveraged OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data

✅ Implemented Retrofit for seamless network requests

✅ Followed Material Design principles for a polished UI/UX

It's about about API integration and adhere to Material Design guidelines.
